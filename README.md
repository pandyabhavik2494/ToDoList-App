# ToDoList-App
Its a To-Do List WebApp created using ReactJS
Basic HTML, CSS have also been used to create this Web App.

The following are the features of the ToDo List WebApp:

1. You can add your ToDo tasks and select a priority for them. These tasks will be arranged according to their priorities.
   They will also be color shaded accordingly.

2. You can then choose to remove these tasks or cross them off. You can also uncross them if you crossed them out by mistake.
   
   
You can demo this WebApp at:

The following is are a few snaps of how the WebApp looks:

I have also created an IOS Application which points to this WebApp.

Do checkout https://github.com/pandyabhavik2494/ToDoList-Hybrid-IOS-App to understand how you can make Hybrid IOS Applications 
that can point to your Hosted WebApps.

Feel free to use the code and have some fun!
